# Stock Management System
This project is a stock management application developed using **Node.js** on the backend and **React** on the frontend. For user interaction, the application offers login functionality for existing users and a straightforward account creation process for newcomers. Users can effortlessly add new information, perform edits or deletions, and manage product-related data such as firm, brand, and stock updates. The system supports sorting and filtering operations on tabular data, providing a streamlined experience. Additionally, users can visualize data through graphical representations, enhancing the overall accessibility and usability of the application.
**Redux Toolkit** is chosen for state management in the project. Additionally, the **redux-persist** library is utilized for persisting the Redux state, ensuring that the state is preserved when the application is restarted. **CRUD** operations are performed using API requests, and **Formik** along with **Yup** is preferred for form validation. The UI/UX design is crafted using libraries such as **Material-UI, Tailwind CSS, Material Tailwind, ApexCharts**, and more.
